PrestonBot
=======================

Carson is a bot that currently runs on the [symfony/symfony](https://github.com/symfony/symfony)
repository. His job is to help automate different issue and pull request
workflows.

For an introduction, read: http://symfony.com/blog/calling-for-issue-triagers-a-new-workflow-and-the-carson-butler

Currently, Carson's super powers are used to automatically label issues based
on comments from people in the community. This gives anyone the power to review
an issue or pull request and comment to update its status. If Carson does his job
well (i.e. if it's useful), more features may be added in the future.

For details on how this review / label process works, see http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/community/reviews.html
